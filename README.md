# minishell
Minishell is a shell program developed in C as part of the 42 school curriculum. The objective of this project is to build a basic shell that can execute common commands, manage environment variables, and handle signals. Additionally, it supports input/output redirections and piping, and includes several built-in commands implemented directly in C
